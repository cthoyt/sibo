Social Insect Behavior Ontology
===============================

This repository was created as a home for the Social Insect Behavior Ontology (SIBO), created by Chris Smith.

This ontology will eventually be integrated into the NBO

Mostly this is collected terms for Chemical, Anatomy, Behavior,
Species.

The most developed use cases are for Pogonomyrmex harvester ant
foraging and apis mellifera honeybee colony defense.
